summary: PyMOL is a molecular visualization system.
description: |
    PyMOL is computer software, a molecular visualization system created by Warren Lyford DeLano. It is user-sponsored,
    open-source software, released under the Python License. It was commercialized initially by DeLano Scientific LLC,
    which was a private software company dedicated to creating useful tools that become universally accessible to
    scientific and educational communities. It is currently commercialized by Schrödinger, Inc. PyMOL can produce
    high-quality 3D images of small molecules and biological macromolecules, such as proteins. According to the original
    author, by 2009, almost a quarter of all published images of 3D protein structures in the scientific literature were
    made using PyMOL.

    This is the Open Source version of PyMOL. The source code is availabe on GitHub:

    https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source

    The commercial version with additional features is available on "https://pymol.org".
